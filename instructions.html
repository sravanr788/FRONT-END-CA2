            <ul>
                <li>
                    If the clicked tile is empty, your score increases. Keep uncovering those empty tiles to boost your score.

                </li>
                <li>
                    But, there's danger lurking. If you accidentally click on a hidden mine, it triggers a blast and increases the mine count.</div>
